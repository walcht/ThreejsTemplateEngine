# About

A three.js 3D engine template similar to that of Unity3D's workflow with
decoupled, event-driven Engine-GUI code (i.e., engine code has 0 GUI code inside
of it and only interacts with it using global DOM events).

The front-end is optionally set to use React and Material-UI but can be very
easily adjusted to any front-end (including Vanilla TS front-end).

## Physics Engine Template

The physics engine used by this *template* engine is Jolt.
